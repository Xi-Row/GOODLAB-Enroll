\subsection{Calculating TFLOPS:}
\subsubsection{}~definition:\newline
"Tera Floating Point Operations Per Second"\newline
TFLOPS is a vital index of assessing the performance of computing device when disposing 
complex calculating tasks, especially in deep learning field where vast calculations happen.

\subsection{Global Load/Store Efficiency:}
\subsubsection{}~definition:\newline
Global Load/Store Efficiency measures how efficiently a CUDA kernel accesses global memory.
It is an important metric in performance tuning because global memory accesses are 
significantly slower than shared memory or registers\newline

\subsection{Register/shared memory usage optimization:}
\subsubsection{}~definition:\newline
Registers are the fastest memory on a GPU, located inside each Streaming Multiprocessor (SM).\newline
Shared memory is faster than global memory and shared among threads in a block.\newline

\subsection{Acceleration Ratio of different scales:}
\subsubsection{}~definition:\newline
The Acceleration Ratio depends on various factors, including the specific application,
workload characteristics, and how effectively the software utilizes the GPU's architecture.
